    Our goal is to find the slowest speed Koko can eat 
    so she finishes all piles exactly on time or just before her limit $k$.
    
    Here is the intuition of how we reach that goal:
    
    Define the Search Space: We know the answer is somewhere between 1 (minimum speed) and 
    the size of the largest pile (maximum speed needed).
    
    Binary Search: Instead of guessing every number, we pick a middle speed and 
    check if Koko can finish all bananas at that rate.
    
    Adjusting the Speed:
    
    If she can finish, she might be eating too fast; we save this speed as a possible 
    answer and try even slower speeds to find the true minimum.
    
    If she cannot finish, she is too slow; we must increase the speed.
     
    The Result: By repeatedly cutting the options in half, 
    we narrow down the exact point where she transitions from being too slow to being just fast enough.

```cpp
class Solution {
  private:
  bool canFinish(vector<int>&arr, int k , int s){
      long long total_hrs = 0;
      for(int pile : arr){
            total_hrs  += (long long)(pile + s -1)/s;    
      }
      return total_hrs <= k;
  }
  public:
    int kokoEat(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        // Code here
        int low = 1;
        int high = *std::max_element(arr.begin(),arr.end());
        int ans = high; 
        while(low <= high){
           int  mid = low + (high - low)/2;
            
            if(canFinish(arr,k,mid)){
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            }
            else{
                low  = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
}; //gfg
